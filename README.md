# Simple-neuron-models
Short pieces of code implementing the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model, and the Wilson and Cowan model for neurons. This is a project for the Instability and Turbulence course at Université Paris Cité, made by Livio Allaraj.

[LIaF.ipynb](https://github.com/Inphynite/Simple-neuron-models/blob/main/LIaF.ipynb) contains the code for the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model, a simplified version of the Hodgkin and Huxley model for the membrane potential variation of a single neuron, under a given input current.

[W-C.ipynb](https://github.com/Inphynite/Simple-neuron-models/blob/main/W-C.ipynb) contains the code for the Wilson and Cowan model of two different populations of neurons, excitatory and inhibitory, and we track the variations of their (proportions of) firing rates under different conditions and parameters.
