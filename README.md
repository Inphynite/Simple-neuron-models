# Simple-neuron-models
Short pieces of code implementing the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model, and the Wilson and Cowan model for neurons. This is a project for the Instability and Turbulence course at Université Paris Cité, made by Livio Allaraj.

[LIaF.ipynb](https://github.com/Inphynite/Simple-neuron-models/blob/main/LIaF.ipynb) contains the code for the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model, a simplified version of the Hodgkin and Huxley model for the membrane potential variation of a single neuron, under a given input current.
